# furiusisomount
Furius ISO Mount updated with Python 3 and GTK 3

I used chatGPT 4 to update all of the code since I dont really know much python or glade, and nobody else updated this to work on current Linux distros that got rid of python 2.

This simulates a cd rom drive for mounting iso files. I have some old windows pc games that I like to run from iso files, but simply mounting them does not work, because the system does not recognize the mounted drives as CD Rom drives. That is not a problem with this program.
